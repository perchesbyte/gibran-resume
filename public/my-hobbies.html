    <h2>My Favorite Movie</h2>
    My favorite movie to watch of all time is any movie of Sherk, because I think it had<br/>
    many types of dramas and enrolling storys with many kinds of magic characters, like<br/>
    Pinochio or the bad sister of Cinderella, also it has a kind of narrative that means<br/>
    you can watch it several times without getting bored, also the music themes and visual<br/>
    effects was one of the best of that time.<br/><br/>
    <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
    One tipycal food that I can always eat, is a burger, I reallly love burgers unlikely<br/>
    are not very healthy, because combie many ingredients that make it really tasty in<br/>
    the mouth, also if you use a expensive meat to made the burger, it also increase the<br/>
    taste, one of my favorites burger shops are Mc Donald's bacause has to many shops<br/>
    around the world, and also with the same flavor.<br/><br/>
    <h2>My Favorite Place</h2>
    I really like to visit Penia de Bernal in Queretaro Mexico becuase in the highway you<br/>
    can stop to eat Padilla's Gorditas that is a tipycal food of Queretaro but with a lot<br/>
    flavor, also you can watch many types landscapes and roads to arrive there, also when<br/>
    you arrive to the town you can see the Penia, that it is the 3rd world highest monolith<br/>
    that also you can climb it with a cheap price.<br/><br/>
